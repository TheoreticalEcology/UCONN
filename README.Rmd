# UCONN


## Installation

You can install the development version of UCONN from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TheoreticalEcology/UCONN")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(UCONN)
n = 100
sp = 10
e = 2
X = mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n, sigma = diag(1.0, e))
w = mvtnorm::rmvnorm(sp, sigma = diag(1.0, e))
sigma = cov2cor(rWishart(1, sp, Sigma = diag(1.0, sp))[,,1])
Y = 1*(X %*% t(w) + mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n, sigma = sigma) < 0 )

model = uconn(Y, X)
model
plot(model)
```
